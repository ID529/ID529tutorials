## Functions: Part 1

<div class="badge bg-primary">beginner</div>

### What is a function?

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. 
Functions are used to make code more modular, which makes it easier to read and debug. 
Functions can be called multiple times throughout a script, which makes them very useful.

### How to create a function

Functions are created using the `function()` command. 

```{r function1, exercise = TRUE}
# Create a function called "my_function" that prints "Hello World!"
my_function <- function() {
  print("Hello World!")
}

# Call the function
my_function()
```

### Function parts

Here's another example: 

```{r}
# Create a function called "add" that adds two numbers together
add <- function(x, y) {
  return(x + y)
}

# Call the function
add(2, 3)
```

Functions have the following parts: 

  - A name (e.g. `my_function`)
  - Arguments (e.g. `x` and `y`)
  - A body (the code executed with the given arguments, put between the `{` and `}`)
    - A return value (the last expression evaluated in the body)

### Calling a function

Functions are called using the function name and parentheses.

Here's an example motivated by a common task in science: we'd like
to report some estimate and its confidence interval (CI). 

```{r function2, exercise = TRUE}
# Create a function with the name format_ci that takes three arguments: 
# x, low, and high, which are numbers and returns a string with the
# confidence interval formatted as "x (low, high)" 

# adapt the following template to do so:
format_ci <- function(___________________) {
  return(paste0(x, " (", low, ", ", high, ")"))
}

# This should return "52 (39, 65)"
format_ci(52, 39, 65)
```

```{r function2-solution}
format_ci <- function(x, low, high) {
  paste0(x, " (", low, ", ", high, ")") 
}
```

### 

Just to improve on the function we just wrote, if we'd like to have this
function format our estimate and CI in a string that conform to journal
requirements.

We could do something like this: 

```{r}
format_ci <- function(x, low, high) {
  paste0(round(x, 2), " (", round(low, 2), ", ", round(high, 2), ")")
}
```

###

As an aside, we could also make the number of digits an argument. Can you figure 
out how we would do that? Can you also take a guess as to how we would set
a default value for the number of rounding digits we want?

```{r functions3, exercise = TRUE}
format_ci <- function(x, low, high, ____________) {
  paste0(round(x, digits), " (", round(low, digits), 
         ", ", round(high, digits), ")")
}

print(format_ci(52.1234, 39.1234, 65.1234, digits = 3))
print(format_ci(52.1234, 39.1234, 65.1234)) # should return (52.12, 39.12, 65.12)
```

```{r functions3-solution}
format_ci <- function(x, low, high, digits = 2) { # set defaults in the function definition
  paste0(round(x, digits), " (", round(low, digits), 
         ", ", round(high, digits), ")")
}

print(format_ci(52.1234, 39.1234, 65.1234, digits = 3))
print(format_ci(52.1234, 39.1234, 65.1234)) # should return (52.12, 39.12, 65.12)
```

###

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info" width='100%'>
  <p class='mb-0'>
  You may have noticed that the solution above has a default value for the digits argument. This means that if we don't specify a value for digits, it will default to 2.
  </p>
</div>

### 

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-warning">
  Something else you may have noticed is that the arguments to functions are 
  always named and separated by commas. 
  
  This means that in calling functions, if you use arguments' names, the order
  in which you specify the arguments doesn't matter. However, if you don't use
  arguments names, R assumes that you're passing arguments in the same order as
  they were specified in the function.
  
</div>

### 

<div class='alert alert-dismissible alert-success'>
  The last subtle thing to point out is that the return value of a function is
  the last expression evaluated in the body. It doesn't matter whether you call
  `return()` on it or not.
  
  In general, most R developers follow a style of not using `return()`, though
  some do because it is more explicit.

  There are times in code when you want to return early from a function, in
  which case you will always need to use `return()`.
</div> 

### Example with Control Flow 

As highlighted above, sometimes we want to return early from a function.
A typical scenario is one where we want to check whether the input to a
function is valid. If it is, we want to continue with the function's
execution. If it isn't, we want to return early.

That could look something like this: 

```{r}
format_ci <- function(x, low, high, digits = 2) {
  if (low > high) {
    return("Error: the low argument is greater than the high argument")
  }
  paste0(round(x, digits), " (", round(low, digits), 
         ", ", round(high, digits), ")")
}
```

### 

There are actually special functions for issuing warnings and error, similar
to print in some ways.

Raising an error is done with `stop()`, and issuing a warning is done with
`warning()`.

Raising an error will stop the execution of the function, whereas issuing a
warning will not.
  
As such, we could have written the previous example as follows: 

```{r, error = TRUE}
format_ci <- function(x, low, high, digits = 2) {
  if (low > high) {
    stop("the low argument is greater than the high argument")
  }
  paste0(round(x, digits), " (", round(low, digits), 
         ", ", round(high, digits), ")")
}

format_ci(52.1234, 65.1234, 39.1234)
```

### 

Or 


```{r}
format_ci <- function(x, low, high, digits = 2) {
  if (low > high) {
    warning("the low argument is greater than the high argument")
  }
  paste0(round(x, digits), " (", round(low, digits), 
         ", ", round(high, digits), ")")
}

format_ci(52.1234, 65.1234, 39.1234)
```



### Summary 

What did we learn? 

Functions have the following parts: a name, arguments, a body, and a return value. 
Their arguments can have default values, and their arguments always have 
names. All functions have a return value, but using `return()` explicitly 
isn't always necessary since R will assume you want to use the last 
expression evaluated in the body as the return value.
